                  Nuxeo platform 5.4.2-SNAPSHOT Release Notes

   Welcome to the Nuxeo platform 5.4.2-SNAPSHOT.

   You can always download the latest releases of Nuxeo applications based
   on the Nuxeo Enterprise Platform from
   [1]http://www.nuxeo.com/en/downloads.

Requirements

   The applications based on Nuxeo EP 5.4 need Java. Please install and
   set up the recommended [2]Sun Java Development Kit (JDK) 6 if it's not
   already installed on your computer.

   Nuxeo is also compliant with the older Java 5, but support for it is
   likely to be dropped in a future release.

   We've also had success running Nuxeo DM on the OpenJDK 6 (the default
   version of Java installed on most Linux distributions). We don't
   consider the OpenJDK as a supported platform yet, but we welcome your
   feedback if you encounter any trouble with it.

   It won't work with any previous release of Java (e.g. Java 1.4).

   Under Windows, virus scan should be configured to avoid scanning
   Nuxeo's installation folder. More details on [3]this FAQ entry .

Getting Started

   After you have installed the Nuxeo application:

   Either follow the Quick installation steps described on the online
   [4]Installation and Administration Guide or the instructions below.
    1. Go to your installation directory.
    2. Start the server:
          + under Linux/Unix/MacOS, run "./bin/nuxeoctl start" to use only
            the terminal or "./bin/nuxeoctl gui start" to display the
            Control Panel (run "./bin/nuxeoctl help" for list of available
            commands).
          + under Windows if you installed Nuxeo from the .zip file, run
            "bin\nuxeoctl.bat".
          + under Windows if you installed Nuxeo from the .exe file,
            either run "bin\nuxeoctl.bat" or use the "nuxeo" Windows
            service.
    3. Point your browser to http://localhost:8080/nuxeo/.
    4. Configure your server using the displayed Startup Wizard.
    5. When the server is restarted, log in using the "Administrator"
       login and the "Administrator" password (no quotes, of course, but
       capital "A").

   For setup and configuration, you should refer to the [5]Setup pages of
   the Installation and Administration Guide.
