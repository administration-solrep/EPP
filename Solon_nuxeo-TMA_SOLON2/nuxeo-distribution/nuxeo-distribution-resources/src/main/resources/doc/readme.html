  <h1>Nuxeo platform 5.4.2-SNAPSHOT Release Notes</h1>

  <p>Welcome to the Nuxeo platform 5.4.2-SNAPSHOT.</p>
  
  <p>You can always download the latest releases of Nuxeo applications based on the Nuxeo Enterprise Platform from <a href="http://www.nuxeo.com/en/downloads">http://www.nuxeo.com/en/downloads</a>.</p>

  <h2>Requirements</h2>
  
  <p>The applications based on Nuxeo EP 5.4 need Java. Please install and set up the recommended <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp">Sun Java Development Kit (JDK) 6</a> if it's not already installed on your computer.</p>

  <p>Nuxeo is also compliant with the older Java 5, but support for it is likely to be dropped in a future release.</p>
  
  <p>We've also had success running Nuxeo DM on the OpenJDK 6 (the default version of Java installed on most Linux distributions). We don't consider the OpenJDK as a supported platform yet, but we welcome your feedback if you encounter any trouble with it.</p>
  
  <p>It won't work with any previous release of Java (e.g. Java 1.4).</p>
  
  <p>Under Windows, virus scan should be configured to avoid scanning Nuxeo's installation folder. More details on <a href="https://doc.nuxeo.com/x/ngQz"> this FAQ entry </a>.
