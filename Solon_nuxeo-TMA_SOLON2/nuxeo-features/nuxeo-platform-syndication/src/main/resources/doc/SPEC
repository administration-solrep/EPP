This file describe specifications for org.nuxeo.ecm.platform.syndication.

NXSyndication intend to provid RSS/ATOM feeds for NXP, for a document and for results search.

The document syndication is called by URL :
getSyndicationDocument.faces?docRef=xxxxx&typeFeed=xxxx

docRef is the full document URL
typeFeed is rss_2.0 or atom_0.3

When a document syndication is called :
-docRef is handled and all childrens are adapted to a List of FeedItem
-the syndication feed is written in the servlet response, using rome-1.0

Note : getSyndication.faces?feedType=xxx can also be called (without docRef).
In that case, the current document (in navigationContext is used).

The search result is also called by URL :
getSyndicationSearch.faces?searchQuery=xxxxxxx&searchType=xxxxx&typeFeed=xxxxx

searchQuery are keywords or NXQL Query, depending on searchType

When a search result syndication is called :
-a search is performed thanks to SearchActionBean
-results are adapted to FeedItems, as for a document

The adapter convert DocumentModel into FeedItem, using the dublincore schema
(dublincore.title, dublincore.description if exists, ...).
The document type appears also in the FeedItem title.

2 links (RSS|ATOM) are displayed in the documents view and in the search results

- generated by SyndicationActionBean, to provide a full syndication URL
(getSyndicationSearch.faces?....or getSyndicationDocument.faces?.....)
- displayed (for now) by an include of syndication_buttons.xhtml.
