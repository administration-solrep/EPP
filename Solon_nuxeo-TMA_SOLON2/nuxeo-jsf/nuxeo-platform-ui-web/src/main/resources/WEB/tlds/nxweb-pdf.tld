    <p>The NXWebPlatform (re)definition of Seam PDF tag library.</p>
    <p>
      This JSF library works as a wrapper of the Seam PDF tag library. As this
      library may not be the one we'd like to keep for PDF generation, this
      wrapper library makes it possible to change easily the implementation
      without impacting templates using it.
