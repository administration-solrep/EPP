Installing
----------

[FIXME: this is not true anymore.]

Installing and starting Nuxeo WebEngine is easy as 1, 2, 3:

1. type 'mvn install package' (this assumes you have installed Maven 2.0.9 and
a Java 5 or Java 6 JDK on your computer, and of course that you have an
internet connection).

2. go to nuxeo-webengine-server/target and unzip nuxeo-server.zip, go to nxserver.

3. start the server by typing "sh nxserver.sh" (Unix/Linux) or "nxserver"
(Windows).

You can now point your browser to http://localhost:8080/ and start playing with
Nuxeo WebEngine, using the Administrator/Administrator login/passwd
combination.
