## About EasyShare
The EasyShare package is an addon for the Nuxeo platform to enable sharing files from the repository with external users not requiring a login. You can specify a set of files to be accessed by a specific unique URL which allows anonymous download of either files within the share or proxies from anywhere else in your repository through a special folder listing page. You can also set an expiration date for sharing availability and track all downloads and get notifications.

This project is an on-going project, supported by Nuxeo
