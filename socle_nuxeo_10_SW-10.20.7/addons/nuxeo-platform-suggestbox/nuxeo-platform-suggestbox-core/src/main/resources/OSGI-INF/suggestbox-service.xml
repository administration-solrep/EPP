    The SuggestionService provides a pluggable way to
    generate explicit suggestions for user actions / intents based on
    contextual text user input and the content of repositories and user
    directories for instance.

    The default use-case is to implement the
    auto-suggest feature in the top right search box of the Nuxeo DM
    user interface for quick keyboard based navigation in the
    repository.
