/**
 * A Type object is used to describe some ECM content.
 * <p>
 * There are two groups of content types:
 * <ul>
 * <li>primitive types - these are builtin types used to describe simple values like string, integers, dates etc
 * <li>custom types - these are used defined types based on the primitive types
 * </ul>
 * Custom types are structured in two groups:
 * <ul>
 * <li>simple types - constrained primitive types. Constraints are specific to each primitive type. <br>
 * For example the "string" type may have constraints like maximum length, regular expression pattern etc. <br>
 * So you can define a custom simple type as being a string that match the regular expression <code>.+@.+</code>
 * <li>complex types - structured types that can be expressed as a tree like structure of other primitive, simple or
 * complex types.
 * </ul>
 * The typing system is mainly inspired from XML schemas.
 * <p>
 * There is a root type called <code>ANY</code> type. <br>
 * Apart this special type, each type has a super type (a type from which it is derived)
 * <p>
 * On top of this typing system there are two high level content types:
 * <ul>
 * <li>schemas - a schema is a complex that can be used to form composite types <br>
 * Because multiple schemas may live together in a composite type they must provide a namespace to avoid name collisions
 * inside a composite type
 * <li>composite types - a composite type is made of several schemas. <br>
 * You can see a composite type as a type derived from multiple complex super types. <br>
 * Composite types are used to define ECM documents
 * </ul>
 * Type names must not contains a <code>:</code> character. This character may be used internally to prefix the type
 * name so it must not be used in the type name.
