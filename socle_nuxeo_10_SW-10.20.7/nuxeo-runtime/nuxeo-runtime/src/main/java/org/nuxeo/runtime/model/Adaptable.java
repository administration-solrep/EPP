/**
 * An interface for an adaptable object.
 * <p>
 * Adaptable objects can be dynamically extended to provide different interfaces (or "adapters"). Adapters are created
 * by adapter factories, which are in turn managed by type by adapter managers.
 * <p>
 * For example,
 *
 * <pre>
 *     IAdaptable a = [some adaptable];
 *     IFoo x = a.getAdapter(IFoo.class);
 *     if (x != null)
 *         [do IFoo things with x]
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * This interface can be used without OSGi running.
 * <p>
 * Clients may implement this interface, or obtain a default implementation of this interface by subclassing
 * <code>PlatformObject</code>.
 *
 * @see AdapterFactory
 * @see AdapterManager
 * @see AdaptableObject
